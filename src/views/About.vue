        <p>My practice focuses on pictorical works, audio registrations, installations.</p>
        <p>
          What interests my artistic research is a registration of the spaces, of the emptinesses, of
          the pauses and silences.
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 0 16px; font-style: italic;">
          Situations of strong gestualities, spaces of absolut silence and of the extreme noise.
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 0 16px; font-style: italic;">
          The peaces of the situations, fragments of images suggested by visual or/and sound
          references, filtered in an instictive way by my sight and related.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intersect my past experience with the world of music with the contemporary visual one :
          the one of the sign and gesture in drawing and painting which leads me to realise my
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside my musical research I developed particular curiosity into the noises, the fragments,
          the accents created by gestures sometimes very wide opened, other times almost
          inperceptible, in the relation with the pauses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result can be translated in the visual way through the execution of the same gestures.
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 0 16px; font-style: italic;">
          The sign is the direct medium as the result of the pretty same gesture when it comes to the
          musical execution as well as the pictorical one.
        </p>
        <p>
          My pictorical practice composes the spaces of pauses and chords, using the white or
          monocrome as the resonance of the silence and the colour as the sound which cuts,
          ricomposes and defines.
